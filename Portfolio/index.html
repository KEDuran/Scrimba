		<p style="font-size: 18px;">
			This site shares a little bit about me. I included a
			<strong>brief background</strong>, <strong>list of hobbies</strong>, and
			<strong>bucket-list items</strong> that are on my back-burner.
		</p>
		<h2 style="color: darkslateblue;">Background</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 18px;">
			My name is <em>Krystal E. Duran</em>, and I am from San Benito, TX. I
			currently live in Pflugerville, TX with my wonderful husband,
			<em>James Marcos Duran</em>, and our fur baby, <em>Caleb Duran</em>. I
			work for the Texas Association of School Boards as a Business Operations
			Analyst and aspire to become a Web Developer.
		</p>
		<h2 style="color: darkslateblue;">Hobbies</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 18px;">
			When I am not working or studying for my UT Coding Boot Camp, I enjoy
			spending my free-time watching movies with my hubby, doing jigsaw puzzles,
			playing World of War Craft, and
			<strong>(most important) going to Disney World!!</strong>
		</p>
		<h2 style="color: darkslateblue;">Bucket-List</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 18px;">
			I enjoy everyday that I am blessed with, and I hope someday I get the
			opportunity for James and I to go on a Disney Mediterranean cruise, visit
			all major European countries, and live to see the day when humans
			establish a settlement on another planet.
